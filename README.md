# popstatgen
This repository has two related but distinct components:

## Extended derivations on statistical genetics concepts

Under the subfolders `sections/`, you will find LaTeX documents (viewable as PDF files) that contain derivations and explanations to equations found in select statistical genetics papers and concepts. You will also find write-ups for more general statistics topics.

## Population and statistical genetics simulator

Under `code/popstatgen/`, you will find a Python package for simulation a population moving forward in time. I plan to write more about it in the future.
